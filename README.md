## Below, you will find the acceptance criteria. Your task is to develop the complete coding logic and create a diagram illustrating the code's conditions. Please use tools such as Figma, Miro, or Excalidraw for this purpose(or simple notepad), and include screenshots from these applications in the repository.

- Ask the user for their choice of goods (options: Fanta - $2, Pepsi - $3, Sprite - $2.5).
  - If the user selects an item that is not one of these three, terminate the application with an appropriate message.
- If the user selects one of the available goods:
  - Ask the user how much money they have.
  - Compare the user's money with the price of the selected item:
    - If the user's money is less than the price, terminate the application with an appropriate message.
    - If the user's money is sufficient:
      - Inform the user that the purchase was successful.
      - Display the remaining balance of money.

This includes the prices for Fanta ($2), Pepsi ($3), and Sprite ($2.5).
